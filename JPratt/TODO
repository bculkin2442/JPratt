@TODO OCt 6, 2020 - Ben Culkin - :RenameMethods
	Rename the command methods. Yes, I know that nullDenotation/leftDenotation
	are the terms of art for Pratt parsing, but they aren't great for telling
	someone who doesn't know the theory behind Pratt parsing.
	
	One idea for names is perhaps parseInitial/parseRemaining

@TODO OCt 6, 2020 - Ben Culkin - :Exceptions
	Since I've written this, I have rather cooled from exceptions. This should
	probably see if it can be changed in some way to not use them, though given
	that Java is missing some of the tools/this isn't designed correctly for
	exception-less code, I may have to deal with it.
